## Loading Data into Tassel

## Loading Genotypes

## Accessor Functions

## Todo

 - Lazier loading, e.g. of specific samples or chromosomes at a time through
   reading in specific sample datasets or subsets.

 - Interface to the `/depth` datasets, which contain a lot of information.

 - Possibly re-looking into storing genotyping data using R's raw atomic
   vector, which will use 1/4 of the memory.
